# Sentiment-Analyzer

A dataset is developed comprising social media comments that can be categorized as positive, negative, or neutral, as well as categorized by five topics: Education, Transport, Crime, Health, and Hygiene. 

Count Vectorization was used to process the data, and a Multinomial Naïve Bayes’ Classifier model was developed with an accuracy of 89%. 
The zipped file includes the dataset, as well as a .py and. ipynb file. 

To classify new data (comments), users may enter them in comma-separated format, and the output will be saved in a csv file named ‘result’.
