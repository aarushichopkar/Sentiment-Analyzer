# Sentiment-Analyzer

A dataset is developed comprising social media comments that can be categorized as positive, negative, or neutral, as well as categorized by five topics: Education, Transport, Crime, Health, and Hygiene. 

Count Vectorization was used to process the data, and a Multinomial Naïve Bayes’ Classifier model was developed with an accuracy of 89%.
